  Halloween is my favorite holiday of the year and I love making my own creative costumes every year. This year, in honor of the halloween season, I decided to create an autumn inspired woodland fairy costume. The costume has four parts to it, the skirt, top, corset belt, and a bag.

  For the skirt I started with a red petticoat as the base and then started to layer multicolor lycra, netting, and tulle ‘leaves’ on top of it. Once I had enough layers and colors mixed in to mask the petticoat, I started placing the fake leaves. For the top, I took a green tank top and meticulously hot glued leaves and small cut-outs of tulle and netting all over the top half and sleeves. For the corset belt, I cut three panels of faux leather, and punched and reinforced holes for the laces. I laced the panels together using suede cording so the laces were on each side of my waist, and then the front lace-up that you’d do to get in and out of it. I also boned each corset panel with cardboard, which actually worked really well and helped it keep its shape and not wrinkle.



  Finally, for practicality, I took a small plain rectangular cloth purse and recovered it and hot glued some leaves and a fun little pumpkin on to it so that it would blend into my outfit. I then had a nice little hidden waist satchel to put my phone in!
