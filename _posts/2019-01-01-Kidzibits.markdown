  Kidzibits is a Minneapolis company specializing in exhibit design, development, and fabrication. Their educational, interactive and kid-friendly work can be seen in children's museums, nature centers, zoos and science centers nation wide. During my time at Kidzibits, I assisted in graphics development of new exhibits for the Minnesota Children's Museum, and the Discovery Depot Children's Museum in Galesburg, IL.

  I aided in formatting and printing prep for graphics, including the creation of a pattern covered play table with my own original pattern design for a new farm exhibit for Discovery Depot.

   I also was tasked with preparing graphics for printing and exhibit integration for two new themed traveling exhibits under a licensing agreement with PBS Kids "Wild Kratts" TV program, for the Minnesota Children's Museum.
