  This ceramic pineapple container was drab and bland when I found it. I gave it a makeover from it's former plain brown & white design with an easy spray-paint job. First I sprayed the body and base of the lid gold, then masked it to make the geometric pattern. I painted the leaves green and sprayed over the body with yellow, and once it was dry was able to pull off the masking to reveal the pattern. I created this as a prototyping exercise for a line of tween girl's room homegoods.
