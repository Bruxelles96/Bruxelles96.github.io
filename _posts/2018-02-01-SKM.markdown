  *"Ruby Segal portrays the heroic Tilius the Paladin, Tilly’s D&D alter ego, perfectly. She’s quirky, skipping about the stage in full armor, but retains the youth that her character never got the chance to grow out of. Segal also shines in moments where the play’s comedy slows down into heartfelt moments of drama."*


  My most recent acting work to date was in Normandale Community College Theatre's production of "She Kills Monsters", a kick-ass contemporary one act play about Dungeons & Dragons. I played the leading role of Tilly Evans/ Tillius the Paladin, the younger sister of Agnes Evans who tragically died at age 16 and whom her sister is now getting to magically reconnect with through Tilly's old D&D games. It was so much fun being decked out in full armor, kicking ass and slaying monsters left & right with intricate stage combat and sword work. My performance earned me a nomination for the Irene Ryans Acting scholarship competition, awarded through the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts College Theatre Festival. The production also earned an encore performance in Des Moines at the Region 5 Kennedy Center College Theatre festival for an audience for 1,200.
