  My most recent acting work to date was in Normandale Community College Theatre's production of "She Kills Monsters", a kick-ass contemporary one act play about Dungeons & Dragons. I played the leading role of Tilly Evans/ Tillius the Paladin, the younger sister of Agnes Evans who tragically died at age 16 and whom her sister is now getting to magically reconnect with through Tilly's old D&D games. It was so much fun being decked out in full armor, kicking ass and slaying monsters left & right with intricate stage combat and sword work. My performance earned me a nomination for the Irene Ryans Acting scholarship competition, awarded through the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts College Theatre Festival.
