  Although I've always loved art, I didn't start avidly painting until spring 2016. This first painting pictured above, was my first landscape I ever did in 2016, painted from a photo I took at the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum.

  I enjoy using acrylic paint as a medium to make art prints for home decor as well as painting more traditional abstract, landscape, portrait, and still-life works for hobby.
