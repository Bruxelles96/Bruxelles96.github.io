  I love tassel jewelry! But sometimes buying new fashion jewelry can get expensive, and making tassels is super easy and cheap! I started with a pair of cheap statement earrings I didnâ€™t love, but would work as a really cute base. 
  
  I made the tassels from scratch from silk thread and after attaching them I decided to add two smaller ones on the sides. 
  
  I loved how they turned out so I decided to try my hand at improving another pair of blah earrings I owned with tassels. After making the two pairs, I feel like I learned a lot about accessory design. I love the symmetry, balance and geometric design in the first pair, I think those elements are really important when it comes to accessories.
