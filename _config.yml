# Description
about1: "Hi, I’m Ruby! I am an illustration major at MCAD, Minneapolis College of Art & Design. My interests lie in creating surface designs and illustrations for products, and strive to create colorful and unique designs that people interact with on a daily basis and can function as outward expressions of personality and decoration."


# Color Settings (hex-codes without the leading hash-tag)
# I recommend using a site like this: https://www.canva.com/color-palette/
# It will help choose a starting pallete. But you'll need to do some tweaking.

#primary
#Background behind profile pic, and about section
#Choose this color somewhat conservatively. I recommend a darker color. Default: 1F2F42

#secondary
#Header, Footer, and large text labels
#This is your accent color, this can pop a little bit. Default: 1F67B4

#secondary-dark
#Section marker and copyright tag
#This color should be conservative, but compliment the accent color. Default: 233140

#background
#Background behind portfolio and contact forms. Default: 111111
