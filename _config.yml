# Description
about1: "As a creative I search to grow through hands-on experience. My dream is to design, create and curate fun and exciting consumer print products such as home products, apparel, paper goods, and textiles. I have a thirst for real life experience and to experience humanity vastly, to expand my artistic view. I spent 10+ years studying theatre; performing in plays and musicals, learning patience and discipline in years of voice lessons, and studying to understand people in order to emulate them on stage. I gained confidence in front of a crowd, people skills, understanding for presentational design and spectacle."
about2: "I love design. Every time I walk into a store I become wide-eyed, studying every bauble and trinket. Culture is everything material and immaterial we surround ourselves with and value and I am so in awe with the beauty in which we can create and weave into our (and customers) lives. I believe that the things we buy and chose to surround ourselves with should be as bright, expressive and unique as every human being is. There are so many different canvases for outward expression out there, so why on earth should anything be ugly?"

# Color Settings (hex-codes without the leading hash-tag)
# I recommend using a site like this: https://www.canva.com/color-palette/
# It will help choose a starting pallete. But you'll need to do some tweaking.

#primary
#Background behind profile pic, and about section
#Choose this color somewhat conservatively. I recommend a darker color. Default: 1F2F42

#secondary
#Header, Footer, and large text labels
#This is your accent color, this can pop a little bit. Default: 1F67B4

#secondary-dark
#Section marker and copyright tag
#This color should be conservative, but compliment the accent color. Default: 233140

#background
#Background behind portfolio and contact forms. Default: 111111
